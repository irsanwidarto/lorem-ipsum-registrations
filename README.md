# Lorem Ipsum Registrations

## Introduction

Business User Bonny is in charge of running the new Lorem Ipsum campaign. As first step in that campaign see needs to collect the names and email addresses of consumers who are interested in buying Lorem Ipsum. 

For that Business User Bonny needs a web app. 

Business User Bonny wants to be able to update the content of the web app herself, without the help of developers, IT support etc.

Business User Bonny: 
- ...knows how to work with web-based tools like Gmail, Confluence, Miro etc
- ...does not have (nor wants to install) Visual Code, Rider etc. 
- ...nor should she have to install any browser plugins or use the Chrome Developer Tools to perform the mentioned tasks
- ...knows how FTP works but still has nightmares using it at a previous job

## Requirements

### Landing Page
The Lorem Ipsum Campaign web app consists of one page with the following elements:
- hero 
- call-to-action text 
- registration form

Business User Bonny has mockups of the web app that could serve as inspiration, but she is not married to these mockups and welcomes your creative ideas:

![website](designs/website.png?raw=true "Mockup Website")
![mobile](designs/mobile.png?raw=true "Mockup Mobile")

### Data Collection
On submit of the registration form, the data should be stored and a "Thank You"-message should be shown.

> Bonus point if you POST the form data to the Lorem Ipsum Registrations API: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ichoosr/LoremIpsum-Registrations/1.0

### Actions that Business Users Bonny should be able to perform
- update the hero and call-to-action text 
- add an extra text ("seasonal text") to the landing page at a position that she wants
